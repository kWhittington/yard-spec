# YARD::Spec [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kWhittington/yard-spec.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kWhittington/yard-spec)
A YARD plugin to embed unit specifications in documentation. In this directory, you'll find the files needed to be able to package up `Yard::Spec` into a gem. Put Ruby code in the file `lib/yard-spec`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yard-spec'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install yard-spec
```

## Usage
There are no usage instruction at this time.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
